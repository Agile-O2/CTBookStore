            "description": "From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”\n\nOne hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?\n\nMost books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.\n\nDr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?"

It's the ultimate guide to streams and still water in Connecticut -- almost 350 pages dedicated to the third smallest state in the Union. Mr. Merly must have worked very hard to write this book, for as far as I know it lists every stream where water flows year round (plus ponds and lakes) -- not a small task, considering that if one were to line up the Nutmeg State's streams they would be as long as the US-Canada border!\n\n            I like this book because it tells me where to access, how many trout the DEEP stocks, maps, pictures, fly line and rod length recommendations, tackle shops, and more. The book is peppered with information that deepens one's appreciation of our state and its natural resources, such as history, natural history, conservation challenges or accomplishments, etc. I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life.",

I would recommend Mr. Merly's book to anyone who wants to try a new river, lake, or stream in CT. The coverage is expansive and clearly separated by county. All of the major rivers and most of the larger streams are covered.\n\nIn a state as small as CT, where you can go from one corner of the state to the other in under 3 hours, it is so easy to try out new fishing areas and this book makes it far less painless than hunting for access; I can have the digital edition open on my phone for last minute access or location changes. Some may argue that the book makes some already pressured areas *too* accessible, but I would disagree. Irresponsible anglers filling five gallon buckets with undersized fish are generally not the ones likely to buy this book. Furthermore, there are miles of vacant river in this state. I can think of three productive spots within a 30 minutes drive where I am not likely to encounter another angler on opening day, let alone any other time of year. Find a blue line you love. This book will help.",

His career as a playwright and actor afforded him the opportunity to purchase a 184-acre estate, where he also built a twenty-four-room medieval-style castle. Overlooking the Connecticut River, Gillette's castle was complete with spy mirrors, sliding furniture, hidden rooms and a three-mile quarter-scale railroad. Since becoming a state park in 1943, it has evolved into one of Connecticut's most popular tourist attractions. Writer and award-winning journalist Erik Ofgang examines the history of an iconic structure and Gillette’s life and role in the evolution of Sherlock Holmes"

The state's history includes landscapes of small farmsteads, country churches, urban streets, tobacco sheds, quiet maritime villages, and town greens, as well as more recent suburbs and corporate headquarters. In his guide to this rich and diverse architectural heritage, Christopher Wigren introduces readers to 100 places across the state. Written for travelers and residents alike, the book features buildings visible from the road. \n\nFeaturing more than 200 illustrations, the book is organized thematically. Sections include concise entries that treat notable buildings, neighborhoods, and communities, emphasizing the importance of the built environment and its impact on our sense of place. The text highlights key architectural features and trends and relates buildings to the local and regional histories they represent. There are suggestions for further reading and a helpful glossary of architectural terms"

But when their mechanism breaks they are discarded, separated from the doll house where they lived and the toy elephant that the child calls \"mother\" (much to her chagrin). Thus begins the suspenseful journey that is heartbreaking, harrowing, and ultimately joyful as the mice seek what seems at first to be impossible: independence (self-winding) and the way back home."

But a serious accident means that Corey Callahan will start school in a wheelchair instead.\n \nAcross the hall, in the other handicapped-accessible dorm room, lives the too-delicious-to-be real Adam Hartley, another would-be hockey star with his leg broken in two places. He's way out of Corey's league.\n \nAlso, he's taken.\n \nNevertheless, an unlikely alliance blooms between Corey and Hartley in the \"gimp ghetto\" of McHerrin Hall. Over tequila, perilously balanced dining hall trays, and video games, the two cope with disappointments that nobody else understands.\n \nThey're just friends, of course, until one night when things fall apart. Or fall together. All Corey knows is that she's falling. Hard.\n \nBut will Hartley set aside his trophy girl to love someone as broken as Corey? If he won't, she will need to find the courage to make a life for herself at Harkness -- one which does not revolve around the sport she can no longer play, or the brown-eyed boy who's afraid to love her back."

Perhaps they married too young and started a family too early. Maybe Frank's job is dull. And April never saw herself as a housewife. Yet they have always lived on the assumption that greatness is only just around the corner. But now that certainty is now about to crumble. With heartbreaking compassion and remorseless clarity, Richard Yates shows how Frank and April mortgage their spiritual birthright, betraying not only each other, but their best selves."

The people of Connecticut take pride in that, even as they struggle to balance the demands of change with old traditions and steady habits.\n\nBy American standards, Connecticut is a very old place. The descendants of many of its original Puritan settlers still live here, and in their names--Hale, Baldwin, Trumbull, Bulkeley--the spirit of Thomas Hooker still seems to cast a shadow. From its beginnings, caution and conservatism have shaped the Connecticut character and have made its nickname, \"The Land of Steady Habits,\" truly descriptive of life here.\n\nYet not everyone in Connecticut shares either that ancestry or that disposition. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, people of decidedly different backgrounds and outlooks joined the scions of old Puritans and Yankees to enrich--and to complicate--the state's history. Though endowed by nature and the shapers of boundaries with few resources and little space, the people of Connecticut from colonial times to the present have distinguished themselves as enthusiastic and talented purveyors to the rest of the nation of a vast array of goods and services. In the process, they have secured for themselves a degree of economic eminence shared by few other places, and they have proven that there is substance in the old idea of \"Yankee inventiveness.\""

He’s got it all—an expensive home in Connecticut, a loving family…and fifty extra pounds that his doctor repeatedly warns will be the death of him. Then, in a moment of carelessness, Halleck commits vehicular manslaughter when he strikes a jaywalking old woman crossing the street. But Halleck has some powerful local connections, and gets off with a slap on the wrist…much to the fury of the woman’s mysterious and ancient father, who exacts revenge with a single word: “Thinner.” Now a terrified Halleck finds the weight once so difficult to shed dropping effortlessly—and rapidly—by the week. Soon there will be nothing left of Billy Halleck…unless he can somehow locate the source of his living nightmare and reverse what’s happened to him before he utterly wastes away…"
